# AWS IoT Device SDK

AWS IoT provides an SDK written in C language, the Device SDK supports the following platforms:

* Arduino Yún: The SDK includes installation instructions and scripts that prepare your Arduino Yún board for connection to [AWS IoT](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/).
* C SDK for embedded platforms \(Linux, real-time OS\): The SDK provides sample applications and getting started instructions to improve the onboarding experience and quickly connect your device to AWS IoT. The [C SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/) also includes a porting guide that helps you modify the SDK’s wrapper functions to support your platform-specific data types, operating system timers, and embedded TLS implementation, so that your application code can remain unchanged when you move from a rapid prototyping environment in Linux to a more constrained and cost-efficient microcontroller.
* Node.js JavaScript runtime package was developed for rapid prototyping on more powerful embedded platforms that support the [Node.js](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/) package ecosystem.
